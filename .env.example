# Vercel KV (Redis) Connection
# Vercel automatically provides one of these when you create a KV database:
# 
# Option 1: REST API (older method)
# KV_REST_API_URL=https://your-kv-instance.vercel-storage.com
# KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your-kv-token-here
#
# Option 2: Direct Redis connection (newer method - what Vercel provides)
# REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@host:port
#
# The @vercel/kv package will automatically use whichever is available.
# 
# For local development, use: vercel env pull .env.local
# This will automatically add REDIS_URL and VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN
#
# VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN is for Vercel CLI authentication and is not needed by the app,
# but it's safe to keep it in .env.local (it's already in .gitignore)

# Quiz Access Code (optional)
# If set, users must enter this code to access the quiz
# Set this in both .env.local (for local dev) and Vercel environment variables (for production)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_QUIZ_CODE=your-secret-code-here

# Admin Authentication
# Admin password for accessing /admin page (server-side only, never exposed to client)
# Set this in both .env.local (for local dev) and Vercel environment variables (for production)
# ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password-here

# Session Secret
# Secret key for signing session cookies (must be at least 32 characters)
# Generate a random string: openssl rand -base64 32
# Set this in both .env.local (for local dev) and Vercel environment variables (for production)
# SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-at-least-32-characters-long
